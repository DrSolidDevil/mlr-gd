# mlr-gd Code of Conduct

<br>

## Introduction
mlr-gd is a welcoming community that encourages participation by everyone. 
We are committed to being a community that everyone enjoys being part of. 
Although we may not always be able to accommodate each individualâ€™s preferences, we try our best to treat everyone kindly.
No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. 
Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, mlr-gd development is conducted in English.

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the mlr-gd project, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. Please try to follow this code in spirit as much as in letter, to create a friendly and productive environment that enriches the surrounding community.




## Our Standards

**Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:**

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being open, preferring public methods for project-related messages and support requests. This ensures better response rates and easier detection of inadvertent mistakes.
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
  
**Examples of unacceptable behavior include:**
* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.


## Enforcement
All complaints will be investigated and responded to. If any instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour are found then they will be dealt with appropriately by community leaders responsible for enforcement of the code of conduct.


All community leaders are expected to protect the identity of the reporter, and treat the content of complaints as confidential (unless the reporter agrees otherwise).


*Possible responses may include:*

Taking no further action (if we determine no violation occurred).

* A private reprimand to the individual(s) involved (minor). In this case, a community leader will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over appropriate communication channels.

* A public reprimand (minor/medium). In this case, a community leader will deliver that reprimand by an appropriate public channel.

* A request for a public or private apology (minor/medium). A community leader will deliver this request. The community leaders may, if it chooses, attach "strings" to this request: for example, they may ask a violator to apologize in order to retain his or her status as a contributor or maintainer.

* A permanent (major) or temporary ban (medium) from some or all mlr-gd spaces (discussions, etc.). The community leaders will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future.

*Minor: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\
Medium: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.\
Major: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.*

<br>
Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, a community leader will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution. The leader will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record. However, they are not required to act on this feedback.
